It has been used for daughters of aristocratic families in England that had ties to Colonial India, such as India Hicks. Just like names derived from seasons like Summer, Dawn, Solstice, Autumn are feminine, India is internationally recognized as a female name since it is the name of a country and it had been used as a feminine given name for more than hundred years in England and the U.S. Although India is a feminine given name in the world, it is not a popular given name in India. Girls who are given this name are usually called with a nickname \"Indy\", or \"Indie\" which are also given names for girls in English-speaking countries.</p>"

The name <i>Dora</i> can also be a short form of <i>Isadora</i>, <i>Isidora</i> and other such compound names.\nThe earliest form of the word <i>doron</i> is the Mycenaean Greek 𐀈𐀨, <i>do-ra</i>, meaning \"gifts\", written in the Linear B syllabic script, but it is not an anthroponym, it is only the plural (δῶρα) of said word; on the other hand, the names <i>Theodora</i> and <i>Amphidora</i> are attested in Linear B as 𐀳𐀃𐀈𐀨, <i>te-o-do-ra</i>, and 𐀀𐀠𐀈𐀨, <i>a-pi-do-ra</i>, respectively. The masculine counterpart of the latter, i.e. <i>Amphidoros</i>, is also found: 𐀀𐀠𐀈𐀫, <i>a-pi-do-ro</i>.</p>"

The name was later borne by the Christian martyr of the fourth century Saint Larissa. \nThe name is spelled Λάρισα in modern Greek and Лариса in Cyrillic, and based on either may also be Latinised as Larisa. It is used in Russian, Ukrainian, Romanian and Latvian languages. In 2009, Larisa was the 21st most common name for girls born in Romania.\nA Russian short form is Lara, made famous through Boris Pasternak's novel <i>Doctor Zhivago</i> (1957).</p>"
